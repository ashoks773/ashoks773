Hi, I'm Ashok Kumar Sharma!  

I am a **Bioinformatics Scientist** at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, specializing in analyzing a wide range of multi-modal datasets to uncover host-microbiome interactions and their role in animal and human health. My work focuses on developing and optimizing computational pipelines, leveraging AI/ML for biomarker discovery, and supporting translational research in digestive and liver diseases.

### ðŸ”¬ Research Interests  
I am passionate about understanding complex biological systems through innovative computational approaches. My research focuses on developing and applying advanced bioinformatics tools, pipelines, and AI/ML models to analyze and integrate multi-omics datasets (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics) to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying health and disease. Specifically, I am interested in:
- Host-Microbiome Interactions: Investigating how microbial communities influence host physiology and contribute to diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and metabolic disorders.
- Multi-Omics Data Integration: Designing scalable, reproducible pipelines to integrate and analyze diverse omics datasets, enabling biomarker discovery and systems-level insights.
- AI/ML in Biology: Leveraging machine learning and statistical models for predictive analytics, patient stratification, and biomarker identification in translational and clinical research.
- Spatial and Single-Cell Omics: Exploring cell-specific gene expression patterns and spatial organization of tissues to understand disease progression and therapeutic responses.
- Translational Bioinformatics: Bridging computational biology and clinical research to develop data-driven solutions for personalized medicine and drug discovery.

My work is driven by a commitment to advancing biological knowledge through computational innovation, collaboration, and open science.
